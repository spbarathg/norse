# Norse – Living Relics Discord Bot (MVP) ✅ COMPLETE

## 🎉 Status: 100% FUNCTIONAL MVP

All core features implemented and tested. End-to-end workflow verified.

### ✅ Completed Features

- **Drop System**: Deterministic RNG, character selection, relic persistence
- **Mission System**: Start, complete, claim rewards with relic locking
- **Economy**: Gold/materials tracking, user balance management  
- **Marketplace**: List, buy, browse with ownership transfers
- **Collection**: View relics, pagination, detailed relic information
- **Decay System**: Hourly durability loss, evolution stage updates
- **Time Engine**: In-game time progression (configurable scale)
- **Database**: SQLite with full schema, migrations, seeding
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for all operations
- **Discord Commands**: Full slash command integration

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

# Run migrations and seed data
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed

# Optional: Register Discord commands (needs bot token)
npm run register-commands

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 🎮 Discord Commands

- `/drop` — summon relic and receive cinematic embed
- `/missions start <mission_id> <relic_ids>` — start mission
- `/missions claim <mission_id>` — claim rewards
